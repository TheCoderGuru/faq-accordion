## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

I learnt how to target css classes in javascript in addition to adding various classes to an eventlistener.


### Continued development

I am a bit unfamiliar with javascript syntax hence I plan to complete more projects involving javascript.
